			<h2>🏠 My homeschooling experience 🏠</h2>
			<p>
				In 9th grade I decided with my sister to do a year of home schooling. This year brought me a lot in terms of personal development. I learned a lot about myself and my desires.

			<h2>🇺🇸 My year as an exchange student in Canada 🇺🇸</h2>
			<p>
				I went to the US, more precisely to Detroit, in September 2016 for 10 months in an American host family. I lived the life of an American 16 year old going to high school and participating in extracurricular activities (Swimming, Running, Lacrosse, jobs...). I had the best year of my life at the time: I played sports every day, my host family was a perfect match for me, I did a lot of skiing, a trip to Montreal...

			<h2>🇪🇸🚜 WOOFING experience in Spain 🚜🇪🇸</h2>
			<p>
				I woofed in Spain for a month between my first and second year of college. I am working on a small family farm as a non-profit.  I'm staying in a hut in the garden. I'm having a great month. I decided to have this experience when I realised that Spanish could be a killer for my exam results. 

				Learnings: 
				<ul>
					<li>
						I improved my Spanish. 
					</li>
					<li>
						I left the world of the prep school (to keep a distance, not to be obsessed, simply the choice not to limit my life to the prep school). 
					</li>
					<li>
						I met new people, I discovered new lifestyles which show me the extent of the possibilities of existence and which question and relativised my own choices: father-son relationship, meal schedule, involvement of the whole family in the meal, the garden and the community, Gaspard a young man of my age who manages a company (truck, finance, leadership, projects)
					</li> 
				</ul>
